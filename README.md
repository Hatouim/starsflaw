## About us

We are students in fourth year of engineering school, majoring in Cybersecurity at ESME Sudria.

As a student and future cybersecurity engineer, we wanted to learn the basics of how to secure an IT infrastructure.

Information systems are regularly attacked by "pirates" or "hackers ill-intentioned ‚Äù, for various reasons (economic, political, etc.). To overcome these cyber attacks, IT infrastructures must be tested through penetration tests to ensure the right level of security.

We then chose this project to learn how to conduct a test first. intrusion, the various attack methods and the corrective measures to apply. Then in the second step, we wanted to transmit our knowledge through a platform mixing courses and challenges in order to provide a fun education on the Security of information systems.

This is why we created Star's Flaw: to bring concepts of Pentesting and Cybersecurity more generally, for those who are interested.
